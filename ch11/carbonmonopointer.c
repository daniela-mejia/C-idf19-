// Making a Difference: Carbon Footprint Calculator
/* 
Carbon Footprint Calculator: Arrays of Function PointersUsing arrays of function pointers,as you learned hopefully so far,
 you can specify a set of functions that are called with the sametypes of arguments and return the same type of data.
Governments and companies worldwide arebecoming increasingly concerned with carbon footprints 
(annual releases of carbon dioxide into theatmosphere) from buildings burning various types of fuels for heat,
vehicles burning fuels for power,and the like. Many scientists blame these greenhouse gases for the phenomenon called global warming.
 Create three functions that help calculate the carbon footprint of abuilding, a car and a bicycle,respectively. 
 Each function should input appropriate data from the user, then calculate and displaythe carbon footprint. 
(Check out a few websites that explain how to calculate carbon footprints.)Each function should receive no parameters and return void.
 Write a program that prompts the userto enter the type of carbon footprint to calculate,
then calls the corresponding function in the arrayof function pointers.
 For each type of carbon footprint, display some identifying information andthe objectâ€™s carbon footprint */
